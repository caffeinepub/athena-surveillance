  "summary": "REQ-14 and REQ-15 appear implemented via a new “Install on Android” dialog (with explicit no-APK + Chrome A2HS steps + offline note) and a header install CTA that triggers the native PWA prompt when available or falls back to the help dialog. However, the project still contains at least one place claiming APK delivery, which violates the BuildRequest constraint to not claim APK/AAB delivery.",

    {
      "requirement": "Do not claim to generate or deliver an Android APK artifact; the project is delivered as an installable offline-capable web app (PWA-like).",
